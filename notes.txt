ASP.NET Core
 - complete re-write of the platform
 - cross platform and open source
 - single platform: MVC and WebAPI are combined, WebForms is gone
 - everything is a dependency
 - low memory footprint
 - multiple deployment support - not only IIS: self-hosting, etc.
 - everything above basic functionality is a nuget package: MVC, logging, Identity etc
 - uses existing web developing tooling (npm, bower, Grunt and Gulp for build automation, nuget package manager)

 .NET 4.6 => .NET Core

 CoreCLR = subset of .NET Framework(has missing features)

 HTML - defines the structure of a web page
 CSS - defines the design of the page

 The Box Model = Content(width and height) + Padding + Border + Margin + (top, right, bottom, left)
    - extra: actual-width, actual-height

JavaScript
  - object oriented: uses prototypical inheritance instead of classes
  - dynamically typed
  - just in time compiled without an intermediate format(MSIL, bytecode)

MVC 6

Bootstrap
 - includes CSS/LESS + JS components
 - modular and skinnable
 - built-in support for 80% of common design methaphors

Bootstrap Grid System - implicitly, there are 12 vertical blocks(columns) across the page
  - col-lg-xx >= 1200px
  - col-md-xx >= 992px
  - col-sm-xx >= 768px
  - col-xs-xx <  768px

EF Core
  - complete rewrite of the platform
  - building Data Access without the requirement on Relational Databases
  - work in progress
  - open source(design and implementation)

ASP NET Identity = replacement for ASP NET Membership
  - supports more types of authentication/authorization: Cookies, OAuth2, etc.
  - pluggable:
      - have complete control over User entities
      - supports non-relational storage of identities
      - supports LDAP/AD stores

Securing WebAPI
  - easiest and common is to use the same Cookie Auth(used for website authentication)
  - better solutions: OAuth2, Open ID Connect
  - cookies are subject to cross-site request forgery
