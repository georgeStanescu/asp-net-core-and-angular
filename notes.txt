ASP.NET Core
 - complete re-write of the platform
 - cross platform and open source
 - single platform: MVC and WebAPI are combined, WebForms is gone
 - everything is a dependency
 - low memory footprint
 - multiple deployment support - not only IIS: self-hosting, etc.
 - everything above basic functionality is a nuget package: MVC, logging, Identity etc
 - uses existing web developing tooling (npm, bower, Grunt and Gulp for build automation, nuget package manager)

 .NET 4.6 => .NET Core

 CoreCLR = subset of .NET Framework(has missing features)
